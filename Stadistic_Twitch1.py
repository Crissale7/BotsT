#Here are the steps on how to create a stat tracking bot for Twitch in Python:
#1. Create a Twitch account.
#2. Install the Twitch Python API.
#3. Create a bot.
#4. Add the bot to your channel.
#5. Write code to track stats.
#6. Deploy the bot.
#Here are more detailed instructions on each step:
#1. To create a Twitch account, go to the Twitch website and click on the "Sign Up" button. Enter your email address, password, and desired username.
# 2. To install the Twitch Python API, open a terminal window and run the following command:///

#pip install twitchio

#3. To create a bot, create a new file called `bot.py`.
#In this file, you will need to import the Twitch Python API and create a new instance of the `Client` class. 
#The `Client` class is used to interact with the Twitch API.
import twitchio
client = twitchio.Client()

#4. To add the bot to your channel, you will need to get your channel's OAuth token. 
# To do this, go to the Twitch website and click on the "Settings" tab. Under the "Developer" section, click on the "OAuth Apps" link. 
# Click on the "Create a New App" button and enter a name for your app. Once you have created your app, click on the "Generate Access Token" button. Copy the token and paste it into your `bot.py` file.
#5. To write code to track stats, you will need to use the `Client` class's `get_streamer()` method. 
# This method returns a `Streamer` object that contains information about the streamer, such as their name, number of followers, and number of subscribers.
streamer = client.get_streamer("your_username")

#You can use the `Streamer` object to get the streamer's stats. 
# For example, values and update them in real-time. Here's an example of how to track the number of viewers:

@client.event
async def event_ready():
    print(f"{client.nick} is online!")
@client.event
async def event_stream_online(channel):
    print(f"{channel.name} is now live with {channel.viewer_count} viewers!")
@client.event
async def event_stream_offline(channel):
    print(f"{channel.name} went offline.")
@client.event
async def event_message(message):
    if message.content.startswith("!viewers"):
        await message.channel.send(f"Current viewers: {streamer.viewers}")
client.run("your_oauth_token")

#the `event_ready()` function is called when the bot is ready to start listening for events. 
# The `event_stream_online()` function is called when the streamer goes live and the `event_stream_offline()` function is called when the streamer goes offline.
#  The `event_message()` function is called when a message is sent in chat. 
#  when the message "!viewers" is sent in chat, the bot will send a message to the channel with the current number of viewers.
#6. To deploy the bot, you will need to run the `bot.py` file in a Python environment. 
# You can use a cloud service like Repl.it or AWS to run the bot. Once the bot is running, you can add it to your channel by going to the Twitch website and clicking on the "Manage" tab. 
# Under the "Channel" section, click on the "Add a Bot" button and enter the username of your bot. 
# Click on the "Authorize" button and the bot will join your channel. You can then start sending messages to the bot in chat and it will respond with the current number of viewers.be of viewers.
